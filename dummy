I’ve completed the KG-RAG PoC comparing Neo4j and FalkorDB using a like-for-like Knowledge Graph and identical embeddings, with the objective of identifying any functional gaps between the two property graph databases.

The results confirm that both databases produced identical query outcomes and KG-RAG results, demonstrating functional parity for the evaluated use cases. FalkorDB required additional development-time validation and stricter schema/syntax checks due to its enforcement model, but this did not result in functional limitations once the loaders and constraints were aligned.

As part of the next step, we still need to validate non-functional requirements, specifically:
	•	High availability and disaster recovery characteristics
	•	Open-source vs enterprise feature limitations
	•	Capacity and volume constraints, particularly given FalkorDB’s memory-oriented execution model

I’ve scheduled a follow-up internal session with the team to review these NFR findings and converge on a recommendation. The aim is to present a consolidated conclusion at the Design Forum next week.

Please refer to the Appendix for details on the PoC design, execution approach, and comparative metrics.
