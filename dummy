Thanks a lot for the feedback and for raising both the Neo4j governance concern and the Stardog angle.

On Neo4j: I agree that, used tactically, a flexible LPG can drift and become hard to govern after a few years. For this initiative though, the intent is to use Neo4j as a strategic, ontology-driven KG, not as an ad-hoc graph store. We’re planning to mitigate the “ungovernable in a couple of years” risk by:

Ontology-first modelling – the policy / procedure / control model is defined in an enterprise ontology (FIBO/SBVR/BPMN-aligned), and we won’t allow arbitrary labels/relationships to be introduced outside that model.

Git + PR–driven changes – all schema and relationship changes will be authored in Git, reviewed by SMEs/architecture, and applied to Neo4j via automated migrations (no direct model editing in prod).

Constraints and validation – using Neo4j constraints and SHACL-style / custom validation checks to detect model violations and prevent uncontrolled schema growth.

Enterprise edition – we would use the Enterprise build (not Community) to get HA, RBAC and operational support in line with other strategic platforms.

I’d be very happy for you to speak to colleagues or previous clients using Neo4j – external experience on what has and hasn’t worked long-term would be useful input to refine the governance model rather than a blocker to using Neo4j.

On Stardog: we’ve already had an initial session with them to understand their value around RDF/OWL reasoning, SHACL, and LLM/vector integration. They are clearly strong in the formal Semantic Web space. However, for this specific “codifying the bank” use case, most of our requirements are around ontology-aligned modelling, multi-hop traversal, lineage and KG-RAG/agent integration, which Neo4j already covers well as an approved technology. The incremental benefit of full OWL-level reasoning doesn’t currently justify the additional licensing cost, onboarding effort and new infra pattern for a second strategic graph engine, especially given others are indeed catching up in this space.

My proposal is:

We proceed with Neo4j as the strategic KG platform for this initiative, with the governance model above to address schema drift.

We keep Stardog on the radar for future, more reasoning-heavy scenarios or a targeted PoC if/when we find clear limits with Neo4j’s graph-based reasoning and there is appetite to introduce an RDF/OWL stack.

I’ve reflected this positioning in the clear choice analysis, but happy to adjust if you’d like it framed differently.


MNPI Platform – Interim vs Strategic State Scope
Purpose

On-demand virtual CDAs only (no materialisation)

In-transit encryption enforced by Starburst

Application-layer MNPI entitlement with IRS/GIRS integration

Column-level masking and policy enforcement via Ranger

Small-scale, low-volume MNPI use case support

Design aligned for seamless future expansion

❌ Not Included

Dedicated MNPI Hadoop or S3 processing/storage layer

Physical or persistent MNPI data assets

MNPI ingestion pipelines and landing zones

Per-use-case encryption zones and KMS key lifecycle management
